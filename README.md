# Nicholas Quist — SOC / Blue Team

I build practical detections, investigate alerts end-to-end, and document my thinking like a real SOC.

## What I work on
- Splunk SPL detections + tuning
- Network investigations (PCAP → IOCs → SIEM pivots)
- Suricata rules + validation
- (Optional) OT/ICS protocol monitoring

## Pinned Projects (start here)
- 🔎 splunk-detections — SPL detections with MITRE mapping + tuning notes
- 🧪 pcap-investigations — case studies with timelines + IOCs
- 🛡️ suricata-rules-lab — rules + test PCAPs + false positive notes
- 📋 soc-triage-playbooks — alert triage checklists and response steps
- 🏭 ics-monitoring-notes — OT protocols + detection ideas (later)

## Current Focus
Building a detection pack + investigation writeups that mirror real SOC work.

## Skills
Splunk, Windows Event Logs, Wireshark, Suricata, Nmap/Nessus basics, MITRE ATT&CK mapping
